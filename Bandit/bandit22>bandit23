ls -al /etc/cron.d/

read the command carefully ,
This line is the one that interest us here : -rw-r--r--   1 root root   122 Apr 23 18:04 cronjob_bandit23
now read this file with :"cat /etc/cron.d/*bandit23" 
We find out that this contain some  command, first setting some variable using some variable

we will use their variable to solve this, why bother creating ours ?
Their variable :
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
		Ours variable :
#			mytarget=$(echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1) # If we have kept their variable value, bandit23 will be replaced dynamically by bandit22, thus resulting in a false value. the command &myname is output whoami command which abviously change from one user to another

We can now use this command to read the famous file :
#			cat /tmp/$mytarget
